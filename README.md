# Defcon-SAO

This project is to create a simple and Fun PCB that works for Defcon as a SAO. Made this because my dad was lazy and didn't want to do it, @ElJjefeDSecurIT.

This will inclued:
  - 0.1" 2x3 connector to connect with badges and other stuff
  - Resistors
  - Right angle or back lighting LEDs
  - cool pirate

For the schematics, I implemented 3 LEDs, one for each of the clear parts on the PCB where there will be no soldermask or copper. The resistors are marked with x as the resistances will vary depending on the LEDs used. This means that for blue LEDs there will be lower resistors and for Red LEDs there will be higher ohm resistors.

The circuit is quite simple so routing wasn't too difficult. The parts were set on the back of the PCB to provide a nice finish on the front while allowing the PCB to still glow from the back.

As you can see, the Pirate is fully visible with exposed copper and areas without soldermask to create a nice pirate.
